## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. On GitHub page, click on the "+" icon on the top left corner of the page, choose the "New Repository" to create a new repository. Fill in the required blanks (name, public or private, license) then click "Create Repository"
2. Open source means that the source code is available to everyone.
3. Open source allows people to cooperate. If a feature or a function is available in open source, one can simply use that feature or function instead of spending time to re-create the same exact function. This is the basic idea of human knowledge inheritance.
4. Licensing helps to protect copyright of the original author, which protects the author's right while allowing others to use the product without asking for permission.
5. Getting into the habit of creating a branch before editing the original copy is the most challenging task for me.
