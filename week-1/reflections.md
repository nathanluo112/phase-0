#1.1 Think About Time
Reading through the materials, the pomodoro technique and the time boxing really caught my eyes. In the meantime, "Make it big by starting small" is a great way to arrange projects into the time boxing scheme, while "tricks for getting into the zone" helps the mental preparation for being more efficient.

Time Boxing means that to set a specific time duration for a certain task. One has to stop working at after the time in the time box run out. This is very helpful to track the productivity and keep the focus. Compounding with pomodoro technique, this will be very helpful in phase 0. Setting up time box of 25 minutes and between each time boxes there is a 5-minute break until the task is complete. This will help to track time it takes to accomplish a task, keep focus, and having immediate feedback for improvement.

Currently I will just focus on a task without a time constraint. Most of the time I will get side-tracked to other topics due to some research on the task bringing up some other interesting topics that caught my attention. As a result, a lot of time is spent on doing random research instead of keeping on track on my main task. With the help of time boxing, keeping on track will be a lot easier and thus increase the efficiency.

In phase 0, I would use the following practice for time management and have minor adjustment accordingly:

1. Set goals.

2. Use time boxing to measure and experiment.

3. Keep track of the time spent on each tasks.

4. Make adjustment according to the difficulty of the tasks.



Habit is a very powerful behavior as well. So I will try to develop some habits to help on performance. Fogg's method has some simple instruction to follow in developing habits.

#1.2 The Command Line
 Shell is the command line interface, Bash is the commands that used for this interface. It is a much more extensive way to control the computer than the regular graphical user interface.

The most challenging aspect is to memorized all the command and additional parameters. During the course, using the commands are not hard but later on using the commands as we go is where the challenges kick in.

In theory, the most important thing is modifying files, in other words, read and write. So first we need to get to the directory using "cd" and "ls", then we will display the file by "less" or "MORE". Editing the file may require a text editor. Also making/moving/removing, which accomplished by "touch", "mv", "rm" is the core of file modification.

Sample commands:

pwd: current active path

ls: list the files in the current path

mv: move a file to a target location

cd: change directory

../: path

touch: create an empty file

mkdir: make directory

less: output the content of the file to console

rmdir: remove directory

rm: remove file

help: ask for help from the console

#1.4 Forking and Cloning

Instruction to Create a repo using Github:

Go to Github.com -> create a username -> click on the "+" icon on the top right corner of the page -> "new repository" -> enter the name for the repository, set it as public or private, use the MIT license on the "Add a license" drop down menu, then click "create repository"

To fork a repository, simply click the "Fork" button beside the name of the repository.

To clone a repository to your local machine, copy the URL of the repository in the "HTTPS clone URL" section on the right panel of the repository page; type in "git clone" in the command line interface with the URL copied. This will create a clone of the repository in the current path.

So far the most challenging part to to understand how git works in the local machine. I believe all the operation will be clear as I use git more often in the future.
