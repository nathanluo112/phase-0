    <p> Overall, I really enjoyed the Fireside Chat. It seems that Shereef is a very conscious being, and I am sure the entire DBC program will reflect his POV.

  <section class="nathan">
    <p>Git is in fact a version control program. The main idea is there is a master/original copy of the project. And new edition to the project will be added to a branched out copy, then push back to the master copy after all the changes are made and tested. All of the changes will be store in a log for future referencing. This is very helpful for collaboration because each "push" has some detail information about what was changed and who made the changes along with some messages the author put up. This requires the author follow the general messaging scheme to ease the referencing in the future.</p>

<!-- Reflection
* What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  We use the section tag more often than other tags and I can picture it being used even more later in web page design. Section is a very generic and straighforward way to define different sections of the content, which is very useful and clear.

* How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  We didn't use head format to further format the page so the content is not very distinguished. But the gab between each section is still visible. Overall the structure is quite clear. The browser display the elements in sequential order.

* What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
Snippet is a very awesome tool! I can see a lot more snippet coming later when we get to learn more useful syntax and format. As we get into CSS, there should be more standard codes/skeleton we can use for snippet to speed up the coding. For shortcut, I am aware of the built-in function for Sublime to open the file in a browser using control click.
