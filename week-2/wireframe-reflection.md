*What is a wireframe?*
Wireframe is like a skeleton of the web page layout. It outlines the web page design where leaving the detail blank at the moment. There is also Hi-Def wireframe which has more detail than the normal wireframe. Basically it is a working progress of the first wireframe draft.

*What are the benefits of wireframing?*
Similar to have a project outline, wireframing allows designers to just focus on the appearance of the web page, separating the whole project into smaller tasks so each one can be completed individually. In other word, it acts like a guideline for web page development.

*Did you enjoy wireframing your site?*
I did enjoy wireframing. I spent quite a lot of time on the wireframes even though they are pretty simple at the moment. It is also very hard for me to do wireframing since I was influenced by different web pages thus not able to think about a "best" solution. I believe as I have more experience on designing, I can bring in more creativity when wireframing web pages.

*Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?*
I revised several times since I was not very sure about the content of my website. Having user experience in mind is very important and relatively easier while wireframing web page.

*What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?*
I was wondering what exactly is a grid. After researching a bit, I found on the Codecadamy that the grid was used by CSS and Bootstrap. It helps to layout the page in a very user friendly manner and easy to design in Bootstrap.

*Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?*
Overall I spent quite a lot of time on this challenge mainly due to the inconsistency of the purpose of my website. Purpose is always the first step of everything. All the following steps will revolve around the purpose. As I was wireframing the pages, different ideas constantly poping up and keep distracting my focus. Hopefully as more work being done to construct the website, the whole design and content can become clearer.
