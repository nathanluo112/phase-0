<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
A lot of the previous knowledge was not registered until we actually use it. We did a lot of recap and research to refresh the knowledge and apply to this challenge.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was easy to use the web to research to find special characters, symbols, and specific HTML5 features. We went through an instance that we are trying to use the <div align> feature to change the alignment in the future but turns out HTML5 does not support this any more. This will be accomplished by CSS

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Initially it was a challenge to determine what should be HTML5 and what should be CSS. In the end we focus on the content structure instead of the appearance.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
At this point, we believe our experience with HTML cannot justify the good and bad about HTML. We agreed that HTML is a very structual way to organize information.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
One of the practices while doing this challenge is write out the close tag right after the opening tag. But in fact Subline Text 2 has this functionality built-in so it will be more convenient after setting it up.
Another tricks is to memorize the self-closing tag and the non-self-closing tag.
