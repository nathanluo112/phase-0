1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of Web Design are:
  1) Information Gathering: knowing the purpose of the web site, goal, target audience and the content being put on;
  2) Planning: plan the web site with the information gather;
  3) Design: the phase to put together the information and design user experience;
  4) Development: implement the design while keep improving the design throughout the course;
  5) Test and Delivery: fully test the website and host the site for discovery
  6) Maintenance: routine maintenance such as backups, upgrade peripheral, add in plugins, etc.


2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

I would like to use the site for informational purpose telling the experience I have throughout the whole process of studying in DBC in NYC. I believe it would be a very exciting advanture.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The target audience will be the one interested in DBC, or lives in NYC, or actually someone interested in me. Life is full of surprises.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Since the site is mostly informational, the primary action for the user is to browse and search for different information.
